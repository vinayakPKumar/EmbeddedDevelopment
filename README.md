# EmbeddedDevelopment
This repository holds all lab and project codes and reports (Related to embedded systems) done by me in collaboration with several other classmates during the first year of my Master's at Ecole Centrale de Nantes.
Subjects included Embedded Electronics, Embedded Computing and Programming under real time systems.

1) Arduino Lab codes: These codes combine various programs each done as a part of a lab exercise of two students. Exercises include basic GPIO writing and reading, LCD operation, switch
configuration, reading from potentiometers and PWM output. The lab also involved interrupt creation and attaching to various utils such as timers.
2) The VHDL codes and the lab report: The VHDL lab report consists of a detailed explanation of all projects done during the course of the labwork. The VHDL code is one for a simple calculator. Developed on a Xilinx Cool Runner CPLD.
3) The report of labwork for embedded devices details a driver development done as a part of the subject Embedded Computing. Driver was developed for an ultrasonic sensor. The report contains complete details of the labwork including the sensor details briefly outlined and the algorithm applied.
4) Lab work for real time systems details all programming done during the Programming under real time systems lab. All development was done on a virtually simulated hardware using Trampoline OS. This lab work includes creating tasks, interrupts, scheduling tasks to achieve some basic applications. This section involves the codes written and a detailed report. Unfortunately the university forbids external sharing of the questionnaire which I why I elaborated on the concepts entailed by this section.
5) IOExpander Driver shows a basic driver developed as a part of the Embedded Computing labwork. It details all the APIs created to allow access to higher level application code. 
6)RTOS Project report: This is the report done alongside a classmate for my second semester project detailed "Study of RTOS Simulation over Linux". The document proposes the possibility of simulating different RTOS over a Linux installation and simulate them without hardware. It details the installation process for each RTOS, the different functionalities and how to use them, the various features etc.
